    "This notebook demonstrates the basic powder data reduction workflow for DREAM in high-flux mode.\n",
    "The workflow\n",
    "1. converts the data to $d$-spacing,\n",
    "2. focuses into a single bin per $d$-spacing (i.e., removes dependency on voxel position),\n",
    "2. normalizes by a monitor histogram,\n",
    "3. normalizes by a vanadium measurement,\n",
    "4. and saves the results to a time-of-flight CIF file for use by [EasyDiffraction](https://easydiffraction.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the mantle detector of DREAM is used in this workflow for simplicity.\n",
    "See [DREAM advanced powder data reduction](./dream-advanced-powder-reduction.rst) for more options.\n",

    "This notebook uses data from a McStas + GEANT4 simulation but can be adapted to other data.\n",
    "The data is available through the ESSdiffraction package but accessing it requires the `pooch` package.\n",
