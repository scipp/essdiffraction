abstract = {The Beamline for European Materials Engineering Research (BEER) is under construction at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund, Sweden. A basic requirement on BEER is to make best use of the long ESS pulse (2.86 ms) for engineering investigations. High-resolution diffraction, however, demands timing resolution up to 0.1% corresponding to a pulse length down to about 70 μs for the case of thermal neutrons (λ ∼ 1.8 Å). Such timing resolution can be achieved by pulse shaping techniques cutting a short section out of the long pulse, and thus paying for resolution by strong loss of intensity. In contrast to this, BEER proposes a novel operation mode called pulse modulation technique based on a new chopper design, which extracts several short pulses out of the long ESS pulse, and hence leads to a remarkable gain of intensity compared to nowadays existing conventional pulse shaping techniques. The potential of the new technique can be used with full advantage for investigating strains and textures of highly symmetric materials. Due to its instrument design and the high brilliance of the ESS pulse, BEER is expected to become the European flagship for engineering research for strain mapping and texture analysis.}
